# Vehicle Horsepower and Fuel Economy Prediction
This project presents a Simple Linear Regression model designed to predict the impact of increasing a vehicle's horsepower (HP) on its fuel economy, measured in Mileage Per Gallon (MPG).

## Project Overview
Understanding the relationship between a vehicle's horsepower and its fuel economy is crucial for both automobile manufacturers and consumers. Vehicle performance and fuel efficiency are often top considerations when purchasing or designing a car. This project aims to create a predictive model that can estimate how changes in horsepower might affect a vehicle's fuel economy, helping consumers make informed choices and manufacturers design more fuel-efficient vehicles.

## Data
The data set used in this project is a curated collection of automotive data. It includes information on various vehicle models, their horsepower (HP), and their corresponding Mileage Per Gallon (MPG) figures. This data will be used to train and evaluate the Simple Linear Regression model.

### Data Columns
Horsepower (HP): The vehicle's horsepower, a measure of its engine power.
Mileage Per Gallon (MPG): The vehicle's fuel economy, measured in miles per gallon.
Please note that the data used in this project is a synthetic dataset created for demonstration purposes.
